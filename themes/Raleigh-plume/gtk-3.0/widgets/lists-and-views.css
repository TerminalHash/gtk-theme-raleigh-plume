/*
 * XXX:
 *
 * Unfortunately, the way GTK+ 3 draws tree views is severely broken.  Each
 * cell in the tree view is drawn using the exact "widget path" (position in
 * the widget hierarchy) as the tree view itself.
 *
 * Because of this, there is no way for CSS code to know whether the tree view
 * itself is unfocused, or if just the cell in question is unfocused.  There's
 * a difference between the two conditions:  Ideally, if the tree view is
 * unfocused, all selected cells should be drawn in a shade of gray; if the
 * tree view is focused, the selected cells should be drawn in the selected
 * background color.  However, only one row of cells in the tree view can be
 * focused at one time; so even if the tree view has focus, if multiple rows
 * are selected, only one row will be colored in the selected background
 * color.  The rest of the selected rows will be gray, which looks totally
 * wrong.
 *
 * For the time being, unless someone has a solution to this problem, simply
 * always display selected cells in the selected background color; never gray
 * out any cells even if the treeview is unfocused.

/*
 * List widgets.
 *
 * While GTK+ 1 had dedicated list widgets as opposed to tree widgets,
 * the simple list widget was deprecated in GTK+ 2, after the treeview
 * was introduced.  The objective here therefore is to try to mimic the
 * appearance of the treeview wherever possible, except for treeview
 * bugs, of course.

/*
 * Normally, any widget that is selected and focused will have a background of
 * @selected_bg_color, and any widget that is selected but not focused will
 * be colored @selected_unfocused_bg_color.  "Completion" pop-ups from entry
 * widgets are composed of a treeview inside a pop-up window; whenever the
 * user hovers the mouse over one of the completion entries, it implicitly
 * selects that entry in the treeview, but does not focus it.  This will color
 * the hovered item gray instead of blue, whereas GTK+ 2 Raleigh colored the
 * items blue anyway.  So add an override to color completion entries blue.
