/* Marco, the MATE window manager */

/*
 * An ugly workaround to let Marco know what color we want it to use for the
 * titlebar of windows.  We set a background color for selected items, but
 * Marco pays attention to the background color of a selected *window*.
 * We always set the background color of windows to gray, since there's no
 * such thing as a selected window, but we create a selector for a phony
 * kind of window here, just to make Marco happy.
 *
 * Who knows?  Maybe other window managers do something this brain dead,
 * and if so:  (1) why? and (2) maybe we'll move this declaration somewhere
 * else in the future.
