Changes from 1.2.0 to 1.2.1

 - Added a few new icon symlinks, to fix more "icon missing" placeholder
   icons in applications, including the "Go" button in the Caja location
   bar ('forward'), and the "Open" button in GTK+ file chooser dialogs
   with gtk3-classic patches ('gtk-open').

 - Fix the transparent action bar in Tilix (thanks to Lewin Probst)

 - Added SHA-256 hashes, a PGP signature, and a deterministic/reproducible
   distribution tarball to the list of downloads.
