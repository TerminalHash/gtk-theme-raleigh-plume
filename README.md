Gtk-Theme-Raleigh is a re-creation of the original Raleigh theme, Red Hat's
(and later the GTK Project's) default theme for GTK+ 2.  Gtk-Theme-Raleigh
brings a unique early-2000's experience to a modern GTK+ 3-based desktop.
The primary focus of this theme is to authentically replicate the look-and-feel
of the Raleigh theme as it appeared between the years 2001-2004, or replicate
the appearance as authentically as possible.

There are other Raleigh theme look-alikes in existence, one of which was a
fallback theme for GTK+ 3 until GTK+ 3.24.  The main difference between
Gtk-Theme-Raleigh and other, similar themes is that this theme tries to mimic
the original Raleigh *to the letter*, appearing indistinguishable from
the original in as many places as possible.  By contrast, most themes designed
for GTK+ 3 or GTK 4 which are "look-alikes" of other classic GTK themes have
many artistic touches of the look-alike theme's own creator; as such, many
"look-alike" themes actually look very different from the themes they are
trying to emulate.

On the other hand, this theme is not purely a knock-off of an old classic
theme.  This theme was written from scratch for GTK+ 3, namely GTK+ 3.20 and
above.  This package also includes a "dark" variant of the Raleigh theme.
The dark variant is of my own creation and cannot be found anywhere else,
as far as I know.  And, even though I simply copied most of the icons in this
theme from old GNOME icon themes and other sources, it took real work to
aggregate all the icons together into this package, and even more work to
rename all the icons to names that modern applications expect.  (Most icons in
the original GNOME icon theme were named starting with `gtk-`, whereas modern
applications expect more generic icon names.  Example:  `gtk-goto-bottom`
versus the modern `go-bottom`.)
